# SIM Cards Loading and Import Issues Fix

## Issues Identified

### 1. Database Schema Issues
- **Migration 0018** drops and recreates the `sim_cards` table, potentially causing data loss
- **Migration 0019** adds `project_id` field, but if table was recreated, existing data would be lost
- The table structure might not match what the application expects

### 2. Import Function Issues
- Employee code lookup could fail due to case sensitivity
- Project name matching might not handle all edge cases
- Import process updates existing records but might not handle all scenarios properly

### 3. Page Loading Issues
- Sim-cards page query looks correct but might fail if database table is empty or has schema issues
- No proper error handling for database connection issues

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Database Migration Fix
**File:** `supabase/migrations/0021_fix_sim_cards_data_recovery.sql`
- Ensures `project_id` field exists in `sim_cards` table
- Creates backup table to preserve any existing data
- Properly configures RLS policies
- Adds proper indexes and comments

### 2. Enhanced Page Loading
**File:** `app/sim-cards/page.tsx`
- Added comprehensive error handling and logging
- Better debugging information to identify loading issues
- Graceful fallback to empty array if loading fails
- Detailed console logging for troubleshooting

### 3. Improved Import Function
**File:** `components/sim-card-import-modal.tsx`
- Enhanced employee code matching with case-insensitive fallback
- Improved project name matching with multiple strategies
- Better error messages and logging
- More robust handling of edge cases

### 4. Diagnostic Tools
**Files:** 
- `scripts/diagnose-sim-cards-issues.sql` - SQL diagnostic queries
- `scripts/test-sim-cards-connection.js` - Node.js connection test

## How to Apply the Fixes

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration
```bash
# Apply the new migration
npx supabase db push

# Or if using local development
npx supabase migration up
```

### Step 2: Run Diagnostics
```bash
# Run the diagnostic SQL script
npx supabase db reset --linked
# Then run the diagnostic queries in the SQL editor

# Or run the Node.js test script
node scripts/test-sim-cards-connection.js
```

### Step 3: Test the Application
1. Navigate to the sim-cards page
2. Check browser console for loading logs
3. Try importing a CSV file with employee and project data
4. Verify that data loads correctly and relationships are established

## Expected Results

After applying these fixes:

1. **SIM Cards Page Loading:**
   - Should load existing SIM cards from database
   - Console logs will show detailed loading information
   - Empty state handled gracefully if no data exists

2. **Import Function:**
   - Better employee code matching (case-insensitive)
   - Improved project name resolution
   - More detailed logging for troubleshooting
   - Proper linking of employees and projects

3. **Database Structure:**
   - `sim_cards` table has proper `project_id` field
   - All foreign key relationships working correctly
   - RLS policies properly configured

## Troubleshooting

### If SIM Cards Still Don't Load:
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Run the diagnostic SQL script to verify table structure
3. Ensure database migrations are applied correctly
4. Check if RLS policies are blocking access

### If Import Still Fails:
1. Check console logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify employee codes exist in the database
3. Verify project names match exactly (case-insensitive)
4. Check CSV file format matches the expected template

### If Data Relationships Don't Work:
1. Verify foreign key constraints are in place
2. Check that referenced records exist in related tables
3. Ensure data types match between tables

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] SIM cards page loads without errors
- [ ] Existing SIM cards display with proper employee and project names
- [ ] Import function works with employee codes
- [ ] Import function works with project names
- [ ] New SIM cards are created with proper relationships
- [ ] Updated SIM cards maintain their relationships
- [ ] Console logs provide helpful debugging information
