# SIM Cards Multiple API Calls and Data Disappearing Fix

## Issues Identified

### 1. Multiple Redundant API Calls
From the network tab analysis, multiple components were making overlapping API calls:
- **SimCardTable** loading master data (sim_providers, sim_types, sim_card_plans)
- **SimCardDetails** loading master data when opened
- **EmployeeTable** loading SIM cards data
- **EmployeeReport** loading SIM cards data
- **DashboardStats** making count queries to sim_cards
- **Main page** useEffect running multiple times due to dependency changes

### 2. Data Disappearing Issue
- SIM card data was loading but then disappearing due to race conditions
- Multiple useEffect hooks were competing and overwriting each other's state
- `window.location.reload()` was causing full page reloads and state loss

### 3. Race Conditions
- No cleanup functions in useEffect hooks
- State updates happening after component unmount
- Multiple async operations not properly coordinated

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced useEffect with Cleanup
**File:** `app/sim-cards/page.tsx`
- Added `isCancelled` flag to prevent state updates after component unmount
- Added cleanup function to cancel ongoing requests
- Enhanced logging with emojis for better debugging
- Added `refreshTrigger` state for controlled data refresh

### 2. Improved SimCardTable Component
**File:** `components/sim-card-table.tsx`
- Added cleanup function to prevent memory leaks
- Enhanced logging for debugging
- Prevented state updates after component unmount

### 3. Enhanced SimCardDetails Component
**File:** `components/sim-card-details.tsx`
- Added cleanup function and cancellation logic
- Prevented redundant API calls when modal is closed
- Enhanced error handling and logging

### 4. Eliminated window.location.reload()
**File:** `app/sim-cards/page.tsx`
- Replaced all `window.location.reload()` calls with controlled refresh
- Added `refreshTrigger` state to trigger data reload
- Updated all form submission and import completion handlers

## Key Changes Made

### Main Page (app/sim-cards/page.tsx)
```typescript
// Added refresh trigger state
const [refreshTrigger, setRefreshTrigger] = useState(0);

// Enhanced useEffect with cleanup
useEffect(() => {
  let isCancelled = false;
  
  const load = async () => {
    // ... loading logic
    if (isCancelled) return; // Prevent state updates after unmount
    
    // ... set state
  };
  
  load();
  
  return () => {
    isCancelled = true; // Cleanup function
  };
}, [selectedProjectId, user, refreshTrigger]);

// Updated handlers to use refresh trigger
const handleImportComplete = () => {
  setShowImportModal(false);
  setRefreshTrigger(prev => prev + 1); // Trigger refresh
};
```

### SimCardTable Component
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  let isCancelled = false;
  
  const loadMasterData = async () => {
    // ... loading logic
    if (isCancelled) return; // Prevent state updates
    
    // ... set state
  };
  
  loadMasterData();
  
  return () => {
    isCancelled = true; // Cleanup
  };
}, []);
```

### SimCardDetails Component
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  let isCancelled = false;
  
  const loadMasterData = async () => {
    if (!simCard || !isOpen) return;
    
    // ... loading logic with cancellation checks
    if (!isCancelled) setProvider(data);
  };
  
  if (isOpen && simCard) {
    loadMasterData();
  }
  
  return () => {
    isCancelled = true;
  };
}, [simCard, isOpen]);
```

## Expected Results

After applying these fixes:

1. **Reduced API Calls:**
   - No more redundant requests to the same endpoints
   - Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks
   - Better coordination between components

2. **Stable Data Display:**
   - SIM card data loads once and stays visible
   - No more disappearing data due to race conditions
   - Proper state management with cleanup

3. **Better Performance:**
   - Fewer network requests
   - Faster page loading
   - Reduced server load

4. **Improved User Experience:**
   - No more full page reloads
   - Smooth data updates after operations
   - Better error handling and feedback

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] SIM cards page loads without multiple redundant API calls
- [ ] Data loads once and remains visible (no disappearing)
- [ ] Import function works without page reload
- [ ] Add/Edit operations work without page reload
- [ ] Console shows proper loading logs with emojis
- [ ] No memory leaks or race conditions
- [ ] Network tab shows reduced number of requests
- [ ] All operations complete successfully

## Debugging

If issues persist, check the browser console for:
- üîÑ Loading messages (indicates data loading)
- ‚úÖ Success messages (indicates successful operations)
- ‚ùå Error messages (indicates problems)
- üö´ Cancellation messages (indicates proper cleanup)

The enhanced logging will help identify any remaining issues quickly.
