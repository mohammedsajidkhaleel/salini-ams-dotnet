# Asset Project Dropdown Feature

## Overview
Added a project dropdown to the asset form, allowing users to assign assets to specific projects during asset creation and editing.

## Feature Description

### What Was Added
- **Project Dropdown**: A new dropdown field in the asset form for selecting projects
- **Project Assignment**: Ability to assign assets to projects during creation and editing
- **Database Integration**: Project assignments are stored in the `assets.project_id` field
- **Optional Field**: Project assignment is optional - users can leave it blank

### User Interface Changes

#### Asset Form
- Added "Project" dropdown field between "Item" and "Assigned Employee" fields
- Dropdown shows all available projects from the database
- Default option: "Select Project (Optional)"
- Projects are ordered alphabetically by name

#### Form Layout
```
Asset Tag *          | Status *           | Condition *
Asset Name *         | Serial Number *
Item *
Project              | [Dropdown with all projects]
Assigned Employee    | [Searchable dropdown]
Description
```

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Database Schema
The feature uses the existing `assets.project_id` field which references the `projects` table:
```sql
-- Existing foreign key relationship
assets.project_id -> projects.id
```

### 2. Component Changes

#### Asset Form Component (`components/asset-form.tsx`)
- **Added Projects State**: `const [projects, setProjects] = useState<Item[]>([])`
- **Enhanced Data Loading**: Added projects loading in `useEffect`
- **Updated Form Data**: Added `project` field to form state
- **Added Project Dropdown**: New select element for project selection

#### Assets Page (`app/assets/page.tsx`)
- **Updated Asset Interface**: Added `project?: string` field
- **Enhanced Form Submission**: Added `project_id` to create/update payloads
- **Updated Data Mapping**: Enhanced `mapAssetData` function

#### Asset Table Component (`components/asset-table.tsx`)
- **Updated Asset Interface**: Added `project?: string` field for consistency

### 3. Data Flow

#### Creating New Asset
1. User fills out asset form
2. User selects project from dropdown (optional)
3. Form submits with `project_id` field
4. Database stores asset with project assignment

#### Editing Existing Asset
1. Form loads with current asset data
2. Project dropdown shows current project selection
3. User can change project assignment
4. Database updates asset with new project assignment

### 4. API Integration

#### Project Loading Query
```typescript
const { data: projectsData, error: projectsError } = await supabase
  .from("projects")
  .select("id, name")
  .order("name");
```

#### Asset Creation/Update Payload
```typescript
const payload = {
  // ... other fields
  project_id: assetData.project || null,
  // ... other fields
}
```

## Usage Instructions

### For Users

#### Creating a New Asset with Project Assignment
1. Go to Assets page
2. Click "Add Asset" button
3. Fill in required fields (Asset Tag, Asset Name, Serial Number, Item)
4. **Select Project** from the dropdown (optional)
5. Assign to employee if needed
6. Click "Add Asset"

#### Editing an Asset's Project Assignment
1. Go to Assets page
2. Click "Edit" button on an asset
3. Change the project selection in the dropdown
4. Click "Update Asset"

#### Removing Project Assignment

### For Developers

#### Adding New Project Options
Projects are automatically loaded from the database. To add new projects:
1. Use the master data management system
2. Add projects through the Projects page
3. New projects will automatically appear in the asset form dropdown

#### Database Queries
```sql
-- Check current project assignments
SELECT 
    a.asset_tag,
    a.name as asset_name,
    p.name as project_name
FROM assets a
LEFT JOIN projects p ON a.project_id = p.id
WHERE a.project_id IS NOT NULL;

-- Find assets without project assignments
SELECT asset_tag, name 
FROM assets 
WHERE project_id IS NULL;
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps
1. **Test Project Dropdown Loading**:
   - Open asset form
   - Verify project dropdown is populated
   - Check that projects are in alphabetical order

2. **Test Asset Creation with Project**:
   - Create new asset
   - Select a project
   - Save asset
   - Verify project assignment in database

3. **Test Asset Editing**:
   - Edit existing asset
   - Change project assignment
   - Save changes
   - Verify update in database

4. **Test Optional Nature**:
   - Create asset without selecting project
   - Verify asset is created successfully
   - Verify project_id is null in database

### Automated Testing
Use the provided test script: `scripts/test-asset-project-assignment.sql`

## Benefits

### For Users
- **Better Organization**: Assets can be grouped by project

2. **Bulk Project Assignment**: Assign multiple assets to a project at once
3. **Project Asset Reports**: Generate reports showing assets per project
4. **Project Asset Limits**: Set limits on assets per project
5. **Project Asset History**: Track asset movement between projects

### Integration Opportunities
1. **Purchase Orders**: Link purchase orders to projects
